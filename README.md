# Minipass Collection

A collection of personal bookmarklet scripts I use to bypass websites that *try* to limit the things you can do, but don't do a very good job at it ;)

These bookmarklets are handy for quickly removing popups, unlocking hidden content, or automating tasks that might otherwise be blocked. 

## How to Use

1. **Open your browser's bookmark list**:
   - Press `CTRL + SHIFT + O` (or `CMD + SHIFT + O` on macOS) to open the bookmarks manager.

2. **Create a new bookmark**:
   - Look for a button with **three dots** in your bookmark manager or simply create a new bookmark from your browser's interface. 

3. **Paste the bookmarklet code**:
   - Head to any script in this repo that you want to use
   - Copy the code
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbd58425-d4db-4bb8-8d40-0fabf7150cc9)
   - Paste it into the URL field of your Create Bookmark popup and give your bookmarklet any name you want

4. **Save the bookmark**:
   - Save the bookmark in your bookmarks bar or another convenient folder.

5. **Use the bookmarklet**:
   - When you're on a page where you'd like to bypass limitations, simply click on the bookmark you created. The script will run and remove the restrictions on the page.


## IMPORTANT NOTES

- These scripts are intended for **personal use** and may not work as expected on all websites. Use them responsibly.
- If you encounter any issues or need assistance, feel free to open an issue on this repository.

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

By using these scripts, you acknowledge that you are doing so at your own risk. I do not encourage bypassing any website's terms of service, and I am not responsible for any consequences that may arise from using these bookmarklets.
