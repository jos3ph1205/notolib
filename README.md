# Minipass Collection

A collection of personal bookmarklet scripts I use to bypass websites that *try* to limit the things you can do, but don't do a very good job at it ;)

These bookmarklets are handy for quickly removing popups, unlocking hidden content, or automating tasks that might otherwise be blocked. 

## How to Use

1. **Open your browser's bookmark list**:
    - Press `CTRL + SHIFT + O` (or `CMD + SHIFT + O` on macOS) to open the bookmarks manager.

2. **Create a new bookmark**:
    - Look for a button with **three dots** in your bookmark manager or simply create a new bookmark from your browser's interface.

3. **Paste the bookmarklet code**:
    - Head to any script in this repo that you want to use
    - Copy the code
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbd58425-d4db-4bb8-8d40-0fabf7150cc9)
    - Paste it into the URL field of your Create Bookmark popup and give your bookmarklet any name you want

4. **Save the bookmark**:
    - Save the bookmark in your bookmarks bar or another convenient folder.

5. **Use the bookmarklet**:
    - When you're on a page where you'd like to bypass limitations, simply click on the bookmark you created. The script will run and remove the restrictions on the page.

## QOL
There is not much I can do about the ease-of-use of the bookmarklets. You're required to click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar in order the scripts to run. As for the permanency of the scripts, most should take effect throughout all of your site as long as you dont close the tab and reopen it.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- These scripts are intended for **personal use** and may not work as expected on all websites. Use them responsibly.
- If you encounter any issues or need assistance, feel free to open an issue on this repository.

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

By using these scripts, you acknowledge that you are doing so at your own risk. I do not encourage bypassing any website's terms of service, and I am not responsible for any consequences that may arise from using these bookmarklets.
